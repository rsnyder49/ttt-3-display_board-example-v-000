# Define a method display_board that prints a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe Board
#Building a simplified first version of a method is a common practice in programming (these methods are sometimes referred to as 'stubs'). By not trying to solve the entire problem at once, we can first focus on correctly structuring our code, laying out some basics for us to build upon. It allows us to get something working as quickly as possible and then improve the code. This process is called iterating on your code and it's just like editing an essay. It's the natural process of small incremental improvements.

def display_board
  puts "   |   |   " 
  puts "-----------"
  puts "   |   |   "
  puts "-----------"
  puts "   |   |   "
end         

def display_board
  print "   |   |   " 
   -----------
      |   |   
   -----------
      |   |   "
end
